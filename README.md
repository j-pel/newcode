# NewCode
A minimalist online editor to ease coding on touch devices

Work in progress:

Touch devices are not exactly prepared for coding. The iPad being specially uncomfortable for writing two or three changes let alone to produce any significant coding effort, regardless the programming language of choice.

The intent of Newcode is to provide an online tool for the people who like programming on the go. Touch controls since the beginning, unlike any of the current editors.

The default keyboards on touch devices are unsuited for coding purposes. They are the first thing to get rid of. Instead, the keyboard has to be customizable, dynamic.
